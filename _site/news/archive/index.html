                        <p>Held since 2012, LLNL’s <a href="https://computing.llnl.gov/newsroom/hackathons">hackathons</a> are 24-hour opportunities to brainstorm, foster creativity, prototype, and explore. Participants work in groups or individually and often strive to learn new skills, programming languages, and tools in service to LLNL’s missions. This year’s spring hackathon (April 30 through May 1) will be held virtually. In true hackathon spirit, several tech solutions will enable participants to collaborate remotely. Charalynn Macedo, division leader for LLNL’s Enterprise Applications Services, will kick off the event with a brief keynote presentation.</p>

                        </h3>

                        <p>For decades, HPC applications used a shared parallel file system for input/output (I/O), but the recent addition of new storage devices in systems—burst buffers, for example—has enabled the creation of a storage hierarchy. The hierarchy can be arranged such that in-system storage is the first level, and the parallel file system the second. For optimal performance, applications must change along with the architectures.</p>

<p>In this <a href="https://exascaleproject.org/software-enables-use-of-distributed-in-system-storage-and-parallel-file-system/">podcast episode</a> (11:28) produced by the <a href="https://exascaleproject.org/">Exascale Computing Project</a>, LLNL’s Kathryn Mohror and ORNL’s Sarp Oral talk about the open source tool <a href="https://github.com/LLNL/UnifyFS">UnifyFS</a>, which can provide I/O performance portability for applications, enabling them to use distributed in-system storage and the parallel file system.</p>

                        <p>As part of LLNL’s <em>Computing 101</em> speaker series, Ian Lee gave a talk to employees on November 12 titled “Software Engineering 101: I have some code! Now what?” The presentation reviewed the Lab’s resources for supporting software engineering and open source development.</p>

<p>Lee, who manages this website and leads many initiatives in the Lab’s open source community, aimed his remarks at relative newcomers to the software development landscape. He also updated the audience on the state of open source development at the Lab.</p>

<p>The Lab provides a wide range of support and solutions for just about any task a developer does: programming languages, package managers, computing platforms, code editors, version control systems, project communication, project tracking, documentation, and much more. Lee provided an overview of these options, offered advice about how to navigate the Lab’s software resources, and encouraged developers to take advantage of colleagues’ knowledge and experience.</p>

<p>Lee summarized the Lab’s recent open source activity, which echoes a trend toward developing “out in the open,”—i.e., not waiting for code to mature before releasing it for community feedback and contributions. (As this website <a href="https://software.llnl.gov/explore/">shows</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/llnl">Lab</a> and affiliated GitHub organizations have almost 600 repos.) Accordingly, the Lab has updated its open source release policies to support modern code development practices.</p>

<p>Among open source projects Lee highlighted in his talk were 2019 R&amp;D 100 Award winners <a href="https://spack.io/">Spack</a> and <a href="https://github.com/LLNL/scr">SCR (Scalable Checkpoint/Restart)</a> and the software stack underpinning the <a href="https://www.exascaleproject.org/focus_area/software/">Exascale Computing Project</a>.</p>

<p>Lee also demoed this website’s category-driven design changes, LLNL’s open source logo (and stickers), the <a href="https://twitter.com/LLNL_OpenSource">@LLNL_OpenSource</a> Twitter account, and <a href="https://llnl.slack.com">Slack channels</a>. He noted that LLNL may have a booth at <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2020/">PyCon 2020</a>, which will be held April 15-23 in Pittsburgh. (Conferences such as PyCon provide LLNL’s open source software community with opportunities for networking, collaboration, and technical skills development. Lab employees interested in attending similar events may contact Ian Lee for funding.)</p>

                        <p>Members of the <a href="https://github.com/esgf">Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF)</a> gathered in Abingdon, England, on November 5-7 to kick off the redesign process for the Federation’s computing architecture. Since the original system was designed a decade ago, the number of ESGF’s supported projects and disciplines has grown and diversified. Furthermore, operational requirements are clearer for the ESGF to support an international federated archive of this size. Many of the ESGF nodes now have other functions beyond CMIP (the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project), and the landscape of data repository and science needs has changed.</p>

<p>Led by ESGF’s Executive Committee, the workshop team discussed improvements to the user experience, data repository and management, data compute requirements, and platform and system administration. This workshop concluded with a high-level roadmap for future architecture directions, which will be presented at the larger ESGF conference in March. LLNL’s delegates to the workshop were Ghaleb Abdulla (principal investigator and co-chair of the Executive Committee), Sasha Ames (member of multiple ESGF Working Teams) and Jason Boutte (Compute Working Team member).</p>

                        <p><a href="https://github.com/LLNL/ExaCMech">ExaCMech</a> is a GPU-friendly library of constitutive models. The models are based on standard continuum mechanics concepts. Crystal-mechanics-based and porosity-mechanics-based models are a principal focus. Models are meant for standard crystalline metallic materials deforming under quasi-static conditions. Constitutive model response is a main ingredient in the simulation of deformation of material, and the constitutive model has two main jobs: It provides the stress tensor that goes into the balance of linear momentum, and it updates the evolving state of the material. This state can be tracked by variables for the stress, dislocation density, orientation of crystal lattices, grain size, and so on. For context, the GitHub repository includes links to relevant journal articles that reference similar models and algorithms.</p>

                        <p><a href="https://github.com/sabersw/pysaber">PySABER</a> is a python package for characterizing the X-ray source and detector blur in cone-beam X-ray imaging systems. SABER is an abbreviation for Systems Approach to Blur Estimation and Reduction. Note that even parallel beam X-rays in synchrotrons are in fact cone beams albeit with a large source to object distance. X-ray images, also called radiographs, are simultaneously blurred by both the X-ray source spot blur and detector blur. This package uses a numerical optimization algorithm to disentangle and estimate both forms of blur simultaneously.</p>

                        <p>Energy systems and their associated information and communication technology systems are becoming increasingly intertwined. As a result, effectively designing, analyzing, and implementing modern energy systems increasingly relies on advanced modeling that simultaneously captures both the cyber and physical domains in combined simulations. It is designed to increase scalability and portability in modeling advanced features of highly integrated power system and cyber-physical energy systems.</p>

<p>LLNL’s Hierarchical Engine for Large-scale Infrastructure Co-Simulation (<a href="https://github.com/GMLC-TDC/HELICS">HELICS</a>) was originally developed for electric power systems use cases, and now it can be used for co-simulation in other domains. The HELICS library provides a general-purpose, modular, highly-scalable co-simulation framework that runs cross-platform. A new repository has been added to the HELICS suite, <a href="https://github.com/GMLC-TDC/HELICS-FMI">HELICS-FMI</a>, which allows functional mockup units to interact with HELICS.</p>

                        <p>At the recent Red Hat Summit in Boston, LLNL’s Robin Goldstone discussed open-source technologies and the Sierra supercomputer. Goldstone, an HPC solutions architect, said “open source makes perfect sense” for scalability and performance in an HPC center like LLNL’s. She stated, “We have all that visibility and that software. If it doesn’t work for our needs, we can make it work for our needs. And then we can give it back to the community because even though people aren’t doing things at the scale that we are today, a lot of the things that we’re doing really do trickle down and be used by a lot of other people.” A transcript of her interview is included with the <a href="https://video.cube365.net/c/914449">video</a>, which runs 15:28.</p>

                        <p>LLNL’s Ian Lee discusses the importance of open-source software and cloud computing for HPC centers and government agencies in this <a href="https://gcn.com/articles/2019/04/24/hpc-hybrid-cloud-open-source.aspx">GCN.com article</a>. He states, “We’ve been doing open source on big Unix systems for more than 20 years. Back then, if we produced open source software for our supercomputers, we were the only ones who could use that software. Now, the software can be ported out and mainstreamed, and it’s a lot easier to make use of supercomputing in other places.”</p>

                        <p>The <a href="https://www.vi-hps.org/">Virtual Institute – High Productivity Supercomputing (VI-HPS)</a> conducts a long-running series of tuning workshops, where participants can learn about programming tools developed by the institute partners. Morning sessions consist of tool presentations and hands-on exercises. In the afternoon, users can apply the tools to their own codes with the help of the instructors. Whilst most of the workshops take place in Europe, the 31st tuning workshop was held at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK), on April 9–12, 2019.</p>

<p>As part of the workshop, LLNL computer scientist David Boehme conducted a 75-minute tutorial on Caliper, an open-source performance profiling library for HPC software. The session included hands-on exercises using the <a href="https://github.com/LLNL/LULESH">Lulesh</a> proxy application as an example. There were around 15–20 participants, primarily HPC software developers from UTK and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, as well as the other HPC tool presenters. This tutorial marked the first time Caliper was presented within the VI-HPS tuning workshop series. Boehme’s tutorial was well received, and several participants were able to successfully apply Caliper to their programs.</p>

<p>The workshop also provided an opportunity to discuss common software infrastructure as well as integration and interoperability possibilities with other performance analysis tools. For example, the <a href="http://icl.utk.edu/papi/">PAPI</a> team plans to explore using Caliper’s data collection and processing functionality. Finally, as a VI-HPS member organization, LLNL’s participation in the tuning workshop series helped showcase the Lab’s strong portfolio of open-source programming tools among the VI-HPS partners and in the HPC community at large.</p>

                        <p>Software development is often a story of teamwork and determination. It’s a tale of persistence through failure toward, ideally, success. At LLNL, this story plays out in countless daily iterations as software teams strive to advance the Lab’s national security mission. When it comes to supporting both stockpile stewardship and foundational science, the VisIt visualization tool is the backbone of LLNL’s computer simulation analysis and visualization capabilities.</p>

<p>For the VisIt team, migration is modernization. Some of VisIt’s original development technologies are now considered ancient. But migrating 2 million lines of code is easier said than done. <a href="https://computing.llnl.gov/newsroom/great-migration-visit-moves-subversion-github">Go behind the scenes</a> as an LLNL team discusses the logistics, challenges, and benefits of VisIt’s complicated move to GitHub.</p>

                        <p>Cardioid is a cardiac multiscale simulation suite spanning from subcellular mechanisms up to simulations of organ-level clinical phenomena. The suite contains tools for simulating cardiac electrophysiology, cardiac mechanics, torso-ECGs, cardiac meshing, and fiber-generation tools.</p>

<p>This project’s history goes back a few years – it was a finalist for the 2012 Gordon Bell Prize – but only now is the code available as open source. Initially developed by a team of LLNL and IBM scientists, Cardioid divides the heart into a large number of manageable subdomains. This replicates the electrophysiology of the human heart, accurately simulating the activation of each heart muscle cell and cell-to-cell electric coupling.</p>

                        <p>ScrubJay, an open-source performance data analysis tool, helps ensure that the Laboratory’s HPC center lives up to its name. Check out this new <a href="https://str.llnl.gov/2018-10/gimenez">writeup</a> in LLNL’s magazine, <em>Science &amp; Technology Review</em>. Fork the repo on <a href="https://github.com/LLNL/ScrubJay">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>ScrubJay is an intuitive, scalable framework for automatic analysis of disparate HPC data. ScrubJay decouples the task of <em>specifying</em> data relationships from the task of <em>analyzing</em> data. Domain experts can store reusable transformations that describe the projection of one domain onto another. The program also automates performance analysis. Analysts provide a query over logical domains of interest, and ScrubJay automatically derives the needed steps to transform raw measurements. This process makes large-scale analysis tractable and reproducible, thus providing crucial insights into HPC facilities.</p>

                        <p>Hierarchical storage systems are the wave of the future for HPC centers like LLNL’s Livermore Computing Complex. The Unify project aims to improve I/O performance by utilizing distributed, node-local storage systems. This design scales bandwidth and capacity according to the computer resources used by a given job. Furthermore, Unify avoids inter-job interference from parallel file systems or shared burst buffers.</p>

<p>Unify is a suite of specialized, flexible file systems – the first is available on GitHub with more on the way – that can be included in a user’s job allocations. A user can request which Unify file system(s) to be loaded and the respective mount points. Tests on LLNL’s <a href="https://hpc.llnl.gov/hardware/platforms/catalyst">Catalyst cluster</a> show more than 2x improvement in write performance.</p>

<p>Like much of LLNL’s HPC performance improvement software, Unify is open source. The first Unify file system, <a href="https://github.com/LLNL/UnifyFS">UnifyCR (since renamed as UnifyFS)</a> (for checkpoint/restart workloads), is already available on GitHub. The team is working on another file system in the Unify “family” designed for machine learning workloads, in which large data sets need to be distributed quickly. Additional Unify file systems are in development.</p>

                        <p>LLNL recently unveiled the new 125-petaflop-capable <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/news/lawrence-livermore-unveils-nnsa%E2%80%99s-sierra-world%E2%80%99s-third-fastest-supercomputer">Sierra supercomputer</a>. Sierra will serve the NNSA’s three nuclear security laboratories: LLNL, Sandia National Laboratories, and Los Alamos National Laboratory, providing high-fidelity simulations in support of NNSA’s core mission of ensuring the safety, security, and effectiveness of the nation’s nuclear stockpile. Its arrival represents years of procurement, design, code development and installation, requiring the efforts of hundreds of computer scientists, developers and operations personnel working in close partnership with IBM, NVIDIA, and Mellanox.</p>

<p>Just a few weeks later, Sierra rose from third to second place on the TOP500 list of the world’s fastest computing systems after reaching 94.6 petaflops on the Linpack benchmark test. The latest rankings were <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/news/sierra-reaches-higher-altitudes-takes-no-2-spot-list-worlds-fastest-supercomputers">announced</a> at SC18.</p>

                        <p>Non-deterministic software bugs are one of the most time-consuming and expensive problems to solve in software development. Furthermore, non-deterministic debugging of parallel applications running on large supercomputers, such as those at LLNL, presents even greater challenges. The PRUNERS toolset offers four novel debugging and testing tools to assist programmers with detecting, remediating, and preventing these errors in a coordinated manner.</p>

                        <p>GridDyn is a power system simulator developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The name is a concatenation of Grid Dynamics, and as such usually pronounced as “Grid Dine”. It was created to meet a research need for exploring coupling between transmission, distribution, and communications system simulations.</p>

<p>While good open source tools existed on the distribution side,  the open source tools on the transmission side were limited in usability either in the language or platform or simulation capability, and commercial tools, while quite capable, simply did not allow the access to the internal components and data required to conduct the research. Thus, the decision was made to design a platform that met the needs of the research project. Building off of prior efforts in grid simulation, GridDyn was designed to meet the current and future research needs of the various power grid related research and computational efforts.</p>

<p>It is written in C++, making use of recent improvements in the C++ standards.  It is intended to be cross platform with regard to operating system and machine scale. The design goals were for the software to be easy to couple with other simulations, and to be easy to modify and extend.  It is very much still in development and as such, the interfaces and code are likely to change, in some cases significantly as more experience and testing is done. It is our expectation that the performance, reliability, capabilities, and flexibility will continue to improve as projects making use of the code continue and new ones develop.  We expect there are still many issues so any bug reports or fixes are welcome. And hopefully even in its current state and as the software improves the broader power systems research community will find it useful.</p>

<p>GridDyn is Open Source software, publicly available on GitHub at: <a href="https://github.com/llnl/griddyn">github.com/llnl/griddyn</a> under a <a href="https://github.com/LLNL/GridDyn/blob/master/LICENSE">BSD License</a>.</p>

                        </h3>

                        <p>Version 0.6.5.6 of OpenZFS on Linux, the native Linux kernel port of the ZFS filesystem, is now available at: <a href="http://zfsonlinux.org">http://zfsonlinux.org</a></p>

<p>Some notable improvements in version 0.6.5.6 are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bugs fixes for case-insensitive filesystem support. Users running Samba servers that export ZFS filesystems will benefit from this update.</li>
  <li>Bug fixes and improved scalability for zvols. Support for asynchronous creation of device nodes. This fixes several hangs and allows pools with many zvols to be imported quickly.</li>
  <li>Add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-gLP</code> to zpool subcommands to print vdev names as a GUID, a real path resolving all symbolic links, and as a full path. This change enables better ZFS integration in Ubuntu’s GRUB utilities.</li>
  <li>Fix a corruption bug where, in certain circumstances, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">zfs send -i</code> (incremental send) can produce a stream which will result in incorrect sparse file contents on the target.</li>
</ul>

                            VisIt 2.10.1 Released
                            <small class="pull-right">March 09, 2016  (release) </small>
                        </h3>

                        <p>Source code and prebuilt executables are available on the <a href="https://visit.llnl.gov/">VisIt web site</a>.</p>

<p>VisIt 2.10.1 contains the following enhancements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>VisIt now permits the -socket-bridge-host command line argument to override the host name passed to compute engines when VCL starts a socket bridge. This is useful for login nodes that are attached to multiple network interfaces such as on BlueGene/Q where compute nodes may need to attach to the socket bridge host (typically the LAC node) using an alias.</li>
  <li>The PF3D database plugin was enhanced so that it reads the new multilevel file format.</li>
  <li>The SPH Resample Operator now supports zone-centered data.</li>
  <li>VTK’s higher order elements are now exposed via Libsim.</li>
  <li>The Silo database plugin now supports all-empty multi-block objects.</li>
  <li>The interpretation of “_meshtv_searchpath” and “_visit_searchpath” was changed in the Silo database plugin. If the search path is blank it will now be ignored instead of causing the plugin to ignore all variables located in subdirectories. The plugin will now ignore all variables located in subdirectories when the search path contains a path that doesn’t exist in the Silo file. This change in behavior was necessitated when we discovered that codes had been unintentionally outputting Silo files with blank search paths for years. Because the Silo plugin wasn’t handling a blank search path properly, this never caused a problem. When the behavior was fixed in VisIt 2.10, VisIt no longer displayed the variables in the subdirectories in its menus when it encountered such a file. Since we couldn’t fix all the existing files, we decided to change the interpretation of the search path in VisIt.</li>
  <li>The pre-built Ubuntu distributions now contain support for reading ITAPS files.</li>
  <li>The PDB Z File database plugin was enhanced to support marker meshes and variables.</li>
  <li>The MFEM database plugin was updated to use MFEM 3.1, which provides support for MFEM AMR meshes. See http://mfem.org/ for more details.</li>
  <li>The ADIOS database plugin was upgraded to use ADIOS 1.9.0.</li>
</ul>

<p>As well as the following bug fixes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The VisItAddPlot() function in Libsim was incorrectly using the global “Apply operators to all plots” setting when creating plots. The behavior for VisItAddPlot() has been changed so new plots are not created with previously applied operators to more closely match the operation of the VisIt CLI.</li>
  <li>Large tecplot files can now be read on Windows.</li>
  <li>A potential memory overwrite was fixed in the Fortran visitgetenv function in Libsim.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where the QT4 include and archive files were missing after doing a ‘make install’.</li>
  <li>Re-enabled adaptive csg discretization for Windows, which was inadvertently disabled for previous release.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug with the PF3D database plugin where the time and cycle were reported as zero for all the time states accessed after the initial time state accessed.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug preventing the reading of DOS-formatted .visit files on Linux.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug whereby setting ‘ssh command’ would not work correctly on Windows. If the path to ssh contains spaces, the full path and command need to be surrounded in double-quotes, e.g., “C:\Program Files (x86)\Putty\plink.exe”. If manually adding this to an .xml host profile, the quotes and path-separators should be escaped: “"C:\Program Files (x86)\Putty\plink.exe"”.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug opening Silo files larger than 4 Gbytes on Windows.</li>
  <li>Fixed the tensorVectorMult bug in the SPH Resample Operator found by Cody Raskin.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug that prevented the SPH Resample Operator from working with the Volume Plot.</li>
  <li>Fixed handling of buggy mmesh_name member of multi-block objects in Silo files.</li>
</ul>

                        <p>Flux is a next-generation resource and job management framework that expands the scheduler’s view beyond the single dimension of “nodes.” Instead of simply developing a replacement for SLURM and Moab, Flux offers a framework that enables new resource types, schedulers, and framework services to be deployed as data centers continue to evolve. This approach is especially important for extremely large Linux clusters like those at LLNL.</p>
