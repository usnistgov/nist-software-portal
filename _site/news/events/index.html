      </h3>

      <p>On November 22, a panel of judges at the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis (SC19) awarded a multi-institutional team led by LLNL computer scientists with the conference’s Best Paper award. The <a href="http://www.sci.utah.edu/~hbhatia/pubs/2019_SC_MUMMI.pdf">paper</a>, entitled “Massively Parallel Infrastructure for Adaptive Multiscale Simulations: Modeling RAS Initiation Pathway for Cancer,” describes the workflow driving a first-of-its-kind multiscale simulation on predictively modeling the dynamics of RAS proteins—a family of proteins whose mutations are linked to more than 30 percent of all human cancers—and their interactions with lipids, the organic compounds that help make up cell membranes.</p>

<p>The team’s software, called MuMMI (Multiscale Machine-Learned Modeling Infrastructure), will soon be released as open source. Read more about the award on <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/news/llnl-led-team-awarded-best-paper-sc19-modeling-cancer-causing-protein-interactions">LLNL news</a>.</p>

        Software Engineering 101: I have some code! Now what?
        <small class="pull-right">November 12, 2019  (event-report)  (story)  (this-website) </small>
      </h3>

      <p>As part of LLNL’s <em>Computing 101</em> speaker series, Ian Lee gave a talk to employees on November 12 titled “Software Engineering 101: I have some code! Now what?” The presentation reviewed the Lab’s resources for supporting software engineering and open source development.</p>

<p>Lee, who manages this website and leads many initiatives in the Lab’s open source community, aimed his remarks at relative newcomers to the software development landscape. He also updated the audience on the state of open source development at the Lab.</p>

<p>The Lab provides a wide range of support and solutions for just about any task a developer does: programming languages, package managers, computing platforms, code editors, version control systems, project communication, project tracking, documentation, and much more. Lee provided an overview of these options, offered advice about how to navigate the Lab’s software resources, and encouraged developers to take advantage of colleagues’ knowledge and experience.</p>

<p>Lee summarized the Lab’s recent open source activity, which echoes a trend toward developing “out in the open,”—i.e., not waiting for code to mature before releasing it for community feedback and contributions. (As this website <a href="https://software.llnl.gov/explore/">shows</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/llnl">Lab</a> and affiliated GitHub organizations have almost 600 repos.) Accordingly, the Lab has updated its open source release policies to support modern code development practices.</p>

<p>Among open source projects Lee highlighted in his talk were 2019 R&amp;D 100 Award winners <a href="https://spack.io/">Spack</a> and <a href="https://github.com/LLNL/scr">SCR (Scalable Checkpoint/Restart)</a> and the software stack underpinning the <a href="https://www.exascaleproject.org/focus_area/software/">Exascale Computing Project</a>.</p>

<p>Lee also demoed this website’s category-driven design changes, LLNL’s open source logo (and stickers), the <a href="https://twitter.com/LLNL_OpenSource">@LLNL_OpenSource</a> Twitter account, and <a href="https://llnl.slack.com">Slack channels</a>. He noted that LLNL may have a booth at <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2020/">PyCon 2020</a>, which will be held April 15-23 in Pittsburgh. (Conferences such as PyCon provide LLNL’s open source software community with opportunities for networking, collaboration, and technical skills development. Lab employees interested in attending similar events may contact Ian Lee for funding.)</p>

        ESGF Architecture Workshop
        <small class="pull-right">November 08, 2019  (event-report) </small>
      </h3>

      <p>Members of the <a href="https://github.com/esgf">Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF)</a> gathered in Abingdon, England, on November 5-7 to kick off the redesign process for the Federation’s computing architecture. Since the original system was designed a decade ago, the number of ESGF’s supported projects and disciplines has grown and diversified. Furthermore, operational requirements are clearer for the ESGF to support an international federated archive of this size. Many of the ESGF nodes now have other functions beyond CMIP (the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project), and the landscape of data repository and science needs has changed.</p>

<p>Led by ESGF’s Executive Committee, the workshop team discussed improvements to the user experience, data repository and management, data compute requirements, and platform and system administration. This workshop concluded with a high-level roadmap for future architecture directions, which will be presented at the larger ESGF conference in March. LLNL’s delegates to the workshop were Ghaleb Abdulla (principal investigator and co-chair of the Executive Committee), Sasha Ames (member of multiple ESGF Working Teams) and Jason Boutte (Compute Working Team member).</p>

      </h3>

      <p>At the recent Red Hat Summit in Boston, LLNL’s Robin Goldstone discussed open-source technologies and the Sierra supercomputer. Goldstone, an HPC solutions architect, said “open source makes perfect sense” for scalability and performance in an HPC center like LLNL’s. She stated, “We have all that visibility and that software. If it doesn’t work for our needs, we can make it work for our needs. And then we can give it back to the community because even though people aren’t doing things at the scale that we are today, a lot of the things that we’re doing really do trickle down and be used by a lot of other people.” A transcript of her interview is included with the <a href="https://video.cube365.net/c/914449">video</a>, which runs 15:28.</p>

        Caliper Library Highlighted at 31st VI-HPS Tuning Workshop
        <small class="pull-right">April 15, 2019  (event-report) </small>
      </h3>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.vi-hps.org/">Virtual Institute – High Productivity Supercomputing (VI-HPS)</a> conducts a long-running series of tuning workshops, where participants can learn about programming tools developed by the institute partners. Morning sessions consist of tool presentations and hands-on exercises. In the afternoon, users can apply the tools to their own codes with the help of the instructors. Whilst most of the workshops take place in Europe, the 31st tuning workshop was held at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK), on April 9–12, 2019.</p>

<p>As part of the workshop, LLNL computer scientist David Boehme conducted a 75-minute tutorial on Caliper, an open-source performance profiling library for HPC software. The session included hands-on exercises using the <a href="https://github.com/LLNL/LULESH">Lulesh</a> proxy application as an example. There were around 15–20 participants, primarily HPC software developers from UTK and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, as well as the other HPC tool presenters. This tutorial marked the first time Caliper was presented within the VI-HPS tuning workshop series. Boehme’s tutorial was well received, and several participants were able to successfully apply Caliper to their programs.</p>

<p>The workshop also provided an opportunity to discuss common software infrastructure as well as integration and interoperability possibilities with other performance analysis tools. For example, the <a href="http://icl.utk.edu/papi/">PAPI</a> team plans to explore using Caliper’s data collection and processing functionality. Finally, as a VI-HPS member organization, LLNL’s participation in the tuning workshop series helped showcase the Lab’s strong portfolio of open-source programming tools among the VI-HPS partners and in the HPC community at large.</p>

      <p>LLNL open-source champions <a href="https://github.com/LRWeber">Laura Weber</a>, <a href="https://github.com/IanLee1521">Ian Lee</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/davidbeckingsale">David Beckingsale</a> attended the <a href="https://githubuniverse.com/2018/program/">2018 GitHub Universe</a> conference in San Francisco. Billed as “a conference for the builders, planners, and leaders defining the future of software”, the team enjoyed hearing about upcoming GitHub enhancements and being able to network with GitHub Federal employees and other GitHub users.</p>

<p>One recurring theme was inner source, the use of open source software development best practices and the establishment of an open-source-like culture within organizations. With this practice the organization may still develop proprietary software, but internally opens up its development.</p>
